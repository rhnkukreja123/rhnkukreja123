The S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval storage class lets our cloud broadcasting customers save on storage costs, helps monetise their data by increasing revenue opportunities, and gives them peace of mind that their data will be accessed quickly when a viewer engages with the content.

The S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval storage class fills a market gap for companies servicing customers in the medical imaging and collaborative care market. Our imaging systems empower some of the largest health systems, radiology practices, subspecialty practices, and clinical research organizations to think about their medical imaging data as an asset that could provide new diagnostic and therapy insights. With these long-lived datasets growing at exponential rates, we not only want to manage cost, but also provide the tooling needed to advance patient care. With S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, we are able to lower storage costs for imaging workloads that require data to be immediately accessible when requested, such as when a radiologist needs to review a patientâ€™s prior history or a collection of archived images needs to be analyzed.
